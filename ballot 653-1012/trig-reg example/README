# Trig-Reg Example

Agenda Item 653-1012

This is an example calculation for the Trigonometric-Regression method for differential settlement evaluation, an extension of the Marr method (the current default in API 653) into the domain of densely-grouped data collected from laser scanning.

This example calculation is performed in the R programming language. The Trig-Reg method requires iterative calculations on data points numbering in the hundreds to thousands, so calculation with a computer program is practically required.

Instructions on setting up your computer to run the R-language Trig-Reg example in the RStudio environment is provided below.

See "trig-reg example markup.pdf" for explanation of the program, section-by-section.

## Running the Code

If you know how to run R code on your machine already, feel free to skip.

1.	Install R. [https://cran.rstudio.com/](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
2.	Install RStudio Dekstop. [https://www.rstudio.com/products/
rstudio/download/#download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/
rstudio/download/#download)
3.	Download the example folder. You can download a .zip at [https://github.com/rbitip/API_Public/](https://github.com/rbitip/API_Public/) by clicking the green "code" button and selecting "download ZIP"
4.	Open the example in RStudio by double-clicking the "trig-reg example.Rproj" file.
5.	Find "trig-reg example.R" in the files sidebar. This is the example calculation. The sample data is "XYZ Example 1.csv".
6.	You can see the code in the editor window. You can run the code line-by-line by using the "Run" button, or run all the code at once by using "Source".
